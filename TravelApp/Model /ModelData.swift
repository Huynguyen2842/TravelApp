Time stands still in the Maldives as you lie on the white sand beaches, hearing the crystal clear waves crash against the seashore, swim with the manta rays and reef sharks and feast on a wide array of fishes with the locals. Be it adventure or leisure, Maldives is your answer. With its sun-kissed beaches, palm-fringed islands, crystalline lagoons and pristine waters, Maldives enthrals and draws visitors all year round. The resorts here are an entire island itself usually, including stay options like overwater bungalows.", imageName: "Maldives", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 10.758256325746386, longitude: 106.67228491141948)),
